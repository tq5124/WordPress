Child-Theme of Twenty Twelve

== Description ===

Twenty Twelve is a fabulous addition to the collection of themes on the WordPress repository.
Now that child themes can also be submitted, I thought I would make one and give Twenty Twelve a test-drive.
One of the best ways to learn themeing is by making a child theme.
So give it a go. Download this one, see what it was like and make your own. 
Or feel free to use this one as is if you like. This theme is solely for teaching purposes.
